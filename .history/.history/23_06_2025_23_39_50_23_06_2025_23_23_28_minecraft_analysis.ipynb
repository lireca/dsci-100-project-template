    "**Predicting Whether A Player Is Likely To Be Subscribed**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s digital gaming world, understanding how users behave is key to boosting engagement and keeping players around. Many gaming platforms use subscription-based models to make money, so knowing what motivates a user to subscribe can guide effective strategies. In this project, we look at how a player’s experience level and their activity during sessions can affect their chances of subscribing. By carefully processing data, visualizing it, and using predictive modeling with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we aim to find important behavior patterns and create a model to predict subscription status.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Summary of findings:**  \n",
    "The goal of this notebook was to see if we could predict subscriptions based on a player’s experience level and session activity. We began by looking at how many people subscribed at different experience levels and session frequencies. The plots showed some patterns. More experienced players were a bit more likely to subscribe, but the difference wasn’t strong. In contrast, the number of sessions and average session time had a clearer link: players who spent more time or had more sessions were more likely to subscribe. Next, we created a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model using three factors: experience level, number of sessions, and average session time. We wanted to find out if these factors could predict a player's subscription status. The model was trained using 5-fold cross-validation to adjust the number of neighbors (k), and the best result came with k = 7. However, even with the best k value, the model achieved only about 59% accuracy on the test set, which was lower than just guessing that everyone subscribed. This shows that the model had trouble telling subscribers apart from non-subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Was This What We Expected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This result was mostly what we anticipated. Before the analysis, we thought that neither experience level nor session activity alone would strongly predict subscriptions. While session frequency did show some correlation, the model's performance confirmed our belief that it would be hard to create an accurate classifier with such limited inputs. The little variation in experience categories and the similarities in session patterns among users likely made it tougher for the model to identify useful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Impact Could These Findings Have?**\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that basic gameplay metrics like session count and experience level may not be enough by themselves to predict subscription behavior. For gaming companies or newsletter marketers, this means that more personalized or behavioral data could be essential for effectively targeting potential subscribers. It also shows the need to avoid relying too heavily on one or two user features when making marketing or product decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Future Questions Could This Lead To?**\n",
    "\n",
    "One important question raised by this analysis is whether we can use this information to better engage players and increase subscription rates. For example, if session activity is even slightly linked to subscription behavior, platforms could find highly active players and target them with personalized subscription prompts or incentives. Also, knowing which player types are more likely to subscribe could help shape marketing strategies. This could involve focusing on new but active players or those in specific age groups. Over time, combining behavioral data with user feedback could lead to engagement strategies that feel relevant and timely for each player, rather than generic or intrusive."
